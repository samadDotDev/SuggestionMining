1.5849625007211563 | 1 | be a nice
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | a nice feature
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | just like android
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | i strongly think
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | strongly think that
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | think that more
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | that more background
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | more background color's
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | background color's should
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | color's should be
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | should be there
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | like instead of
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | of just black
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | just black and
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | green and stuff
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | make it so
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | it so the
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | the xbox app
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | would like a
1.5849625007211563 | 0 | NOT_the NOT_status NOT_bar

1.5849625007211563 | 0 | of the box
1.5849625007211563 | 0 | impossible to get

1.5849625007211563 | 1 | also it would
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | app to a
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | to a uwp
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | NOT_again NOT_and NOT_again
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | explorer with the

1.5849625007211563 | 1 | to something like
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | it might make
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | might make sense
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | useful if this
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | great if we
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | if it could
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | can be the
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | on apple ios
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | where we can
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | by default in
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | each and every
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | really need to
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | an opt in
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | at least this
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | least this would
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | for most applications
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | the explorer and
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | of the items
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | declared in the
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | can you add
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | main window of

1.5849625007211563 | 1 | a parameter to
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | so i propose
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | i'm suggesting a
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | please add to
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | to see support
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | see support for
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | helpful is to
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | of the system
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | should still be
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | in the sdk
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | control so that
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | NOT_to NOT_the NOT_full
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | better if it
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | are needed for
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | the draw call
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | should be removed
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | we can also
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | would save a
1.5849625007211563 | 1 | app to launch

0.5849625007211561 | 1 | idea is to
0.5849625007211561 | 1 | based on the

0.0 | 0 | windows mobile phones
0.0 | 0 | way for developers

0.0 | 0 | a new feature
0.0 | 0 | the contact class
0.0 | 0 | from the contact
0.0 | 0 | made available to

0.0 | 0 | the amount of

0.0 | 0 | return to the

0.0 | 0 | file type association
0.0 | 0 | making it possible
0.0 | 0 | can be made
0.0 | 0 | be made available
0.0 | 0 | i would suggest
0.0 | 0 | we can do
0.0 | 0 | can do with
0.0 | 0 | this must be
0.0 | 0 | a native c
0.0 | 0 | so we are
0.0 | 0 | a transparent background
0.0 | 0 | background in the
0.0 | 0 | or the app
0.0 | 0 | application so that
0.0 | 0 | in the browser
0.0 | 0 | and do not
0.0 | 0 | be extended to
0.0 | 0 | of us who
0.0 | 0 | box in the
0.0 | 0 | to allow developers
0.0 | 0 | please leave your
0.0 | 0 | information to the
0.0 | 0 | to ask for
0.0 | 0 | user might want
0.0 | 0 | going to ask
0.0 | 0 | time i want
0.0 | 0 | this feature will
0.0 | 0 | to opt out
0.0 | 0 | within our apps
0.0 | 0 | apps that run
0.0 | 0 | we can trigger
0.0 | 0 | run in background
0.0 | 0 | order to support
0.0 | 0 | NOT_property NOT_or NOT_method
0.0 | 0 | toolkit to get
0.0 | 0 | integrated with the
0.0 | 0 | to the platform
0.0 | 0 | in their application
0.0 | 0 | can open the
0.0 | 0 | it shows the
0.0 | 0 | allow applications to
0.0 | 0 | to the application
0.0 | 0 | on all the
0.0 | 0 | where i can
0.0 | 0 | extend the api
0.0 | 0 | to the hardware
0.0 | 0 | a business app
0.0 | 0 | on mobile devices
0.0 | 0 | this case an
0.0 | 0 | are in the
0.0 | 0 | we can use
0.0 | 0 | think this should
0.0 | 0 | but i guess
0.0 | 0 | access to that
0.0 | 0 | since i can
0.0 | 0 | NOT_to NOT_the NOT_user
0.0 | 0 | like apple does
0.0 | 0 | adding an image
0.0 | 0 | may wish to
0.0 | 0 | as opposed to

0.0 | 0 | i dont like
0.0 | 0 | an app can
0.0 | 0 | the concept of
0.0 | 0 | we could make
0.0 | 0 | depend on a
0.0 | 0 | were to be
0.0 | 0 | with any other
0.0 | 0 | to make it
0.0 | 0 | that instead of
0.0 | 0 | open up the
0.0 | 0 | way of accessing

0.0 | 0 | to take a
0.0 | 0 | a screen capture
0.0 | 0 | in the saved
0.0 | 0 | that you have
0.0 | 0 | button is not
0.0 | 0 | us to get

0.0 | 0 | can have a
0.0 | 0 | will need to
0.0 | 0 | we can create
0.0 | 0 | app but it
0.0 | 0 | we need an
0.0 | 0 | apps for wp
0.0 | 0 | have a nice
0.0 | 0 | app in a
0.0 | 0 | the app you
0.0 | 0 | solution is to
0.0 | 0 | will make the
0.0 | 0 | see all of
0.0 | 0 | as a string
0.0 | 0 | someone elses idea
0.0 | 0 | my votes to
0.0 | 0 | call history is
0.0 | 0 | not NOT_possible NOT_at
0.0 | 0 | for fm radio
0.0 | 0 | the application on
0.0 | 0 | between applications in
0.0 | 0 | applications in something
0.0 | 0 | in something that
0.0 | 0 | something that could
0.0 | 0 | want to delete
0.0 | 0 | in the e
0.0 | 0 | not NOT_allow NOT_a
0.0 | 0 | a much better
0.0 | 0 | ability to make
0.0 | 0 | option to delete
0.0 | 0 | to delete all
0.0 | 0 | a control which
0.0 | 0 | then copy it
0.0 | 0 | to a windows
0.0 | 0 | to add two
0.0 | 0 | to reduce the
0.0 | 0 | the same notification
0.0 | 0 | at least for
0.0 | 0 | on this phone
0.0 | 0 | really liked the
0.0 | 0 | address can be
0.0 | 0 | want is to
0.0 | 0 | app that will
0.0 | 0 | touch sensitive buttons
0.0 | 0 | so much easier
0.0 | 0 | to be at
0.0 | 0 | a treeview control
0.0 | 0 | treeview control to
0.0 | 0 | to display a
0.0 | 0 | i can read
0.0 | 0 | push it to
0.0 | 0 | to the podcast
0.0 | 0 | that are in
0.0 | 0 | that provides access
0.0 | 0 | provides access to
0.0 | 0 | to a podcast
0.0 | 0 | way to submit
0.0 | 0 | it is too
0.0 | 0 | if for some
0.0 | 0 | some reason your
0.0 | 0 | scenarios such as
0.0 | 0 | the bing maps
0.0 | 0 | on for example
0.0 | 0 | NOT_the NOT_user NOT_actually
0.0 | 0 | able to download
0.0 | 0 | has the ability
0.0 | 0 | a new setting
0.0 | 0 | that allows users
0.0 | 0 | i could view
0.0 | 0 | and some other
0.0 | 0 | so we don't
0.0 | 0 | is part of
0.0 | 0 | phones on the
0.0 | 0 | the contact data
0.0 | 0 | to convert my
0.0 | 0 | with no NOT_additional
0.0 | 0 | doesn't have a
0.0 | 0 | color of the
0.0 | 0 | apps that are
0.0 | 0 | never be published
0.0 | 0 | i believe this
0.0 | 0 | that depend on
0.0 | 0 | to provide an
0.0 | 0 | support to allow
0.0 | 0 | be placed in
0.0 | 0 | placed in a
0.0 | 0 | a running app
0.0 | 0 | idea would be
0.0 | 0 | the user if
0.0 | 0 | those of us
0.0 | 0 | quite a few
0.0 | 0 | and use them
0.0 | 0 | code once and
0.0 | 0 | files instead of
0.0 | 0 | on the virtual
0.0 | 0 | to bring up
0.0 | 0 | in the near
0.0 | 0 | the near future
0.0 | 0 | not NOT_contain NOT_the
0.0 | 0 | so the only
0.0 | 0 | i realize that
0.0 | 0 | support it if
0.0 | 0 | search button on
0.0 | 0 | by number of
0.0 | 0 | is already available
0.0 | 0 | the user in
0.0 | 0 | user in the
0.0 | 0 | the store without
0.0 | 0 | back to how
0.0 | 0 | to how it
0.0 | 0 | how it was
0.0 | 0 | it was on
0.0 | 0 | was on the
0.0 | 0 | on the old
0.0 | 0 | the old dashboard
0.0 | 0 | old dashboard would
0.0 | 0 | dashboard would be
0.0 | 0 | would be ideal
0.0 | 0 | a simple link
0.0 | 0 | simple link to
0.0 | 0 | link to toggle
0.0 | 0 | to toggle between
0.0 | 0 | toggle between visible
0.0 | 0 | between visible and
0.0 | 0 | visible and hidden
0.0 | 0 | see the total
0.0 | 0 | would be if
0.0 | 0 | needed to create
0.0 | 0 | there were an
0.0 | 0 | some of us
0.0 | 0 | to start the
0.0 | 0 | an app deployment
0.0 | 0 | app deployment should
0.0 | 0 | deployment should unlock
0.0 | 0 | should unlock the
0.0 | 0 | screen and reset
0.0 | 0 | and reset the
0.0 | 0 | it was possible
0.0 | 0 | new test users
0.0 | 0 | in real time
0.0 | 0 | their apps to
0.0 | 0 | when working with
0.0 | 0 | please support the
0.0 | 0 | option to the
0.0 | 0 | to be some
0.0 | 0 | in your windows
0.0 | 0 | be a great
0.0 | 0 | way to better
0.0 | 0 | should provide a
0.0 | 0 | NOT_be NOT_provided NOT_in
0.0 | 0 | NOT_provided NOT_in NOT_the
0.0 | 0 | for such a
0.0 | 0 | at least each
0.0 | 0 | from having to
0.0 | 0 | on the emulator
0.0 | 0 | like the picture
0.0 | 0 | twitter and facebook
0.0 | 0 | on the list
0.0 | 0 | developers and microsoft
0.0 | 0 | we can just
0.0 | 0 | can just use
0.0 | 0 | we already have
0.0 | 0 | new version of

0.0 | 0 | the blog post
0.0 | 0 | still be able
0.0 | 0 | name of the
0.0 | 0 | instead of showing
0.0 | 0 | NOT_it NOT_is NOT_not
0.0 | 0 | that app can
0.0 | 0 | app can have
0.0 | 0 | the main problem
0.0 | 0 | main problem is
0.0 | 0 | that the new
0.0 | 0 | new users don't
0.0 | 0 | users don't know
